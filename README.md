# Launching-a-Linux-Instance-Using-the-AWS-CLI

When we purchase a laptop, we have a physical device in front of us that we can log in to after setting up our account. However, EC2 instances are in the cloud, and we are expected to connect to our instances to manage hardware, maintain software, deploy application packages, and complete other tasks.

## Objectives
1. Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI
2. Create key pairs and network resources using the AWS CLI
3. Verify the instance in the AWS Console
